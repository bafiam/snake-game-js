<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

An endless game of feed the snake where the player controls the snakehead and direct it the food. Once the snake feeds it grows in body length. The snake is in constant movement and is able to disappear on one side and appear on the opposite side. The food also appears randomly on the platform. The rule is to make sure that the snakehead does not collide with the body which will result in a game over scenario.
